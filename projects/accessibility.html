    <p>Foundation Medicine is a company that provides genomic testing to cancer patients to match them with treatments and clinical trials. A partnership with the Departmetn of Veterans Affairs prompted the start of the accessibility project. To get this started, we did an accessibility audit with a third party to get a better idea of what we needed to work on.</p>
    <p>Since we were designing for somewhat of a niche audience, primarily health care providers, we really wanted to keep in mind the types of disabilities to ensure that we were being sufficiently broad with our definition of accessibility.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multiple versions of the same component with inconsistent spacing, color, text sizes, creating additional work for development teams:</strong> Simplify components for a strong, clear, visual language.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of documentation results in confusion when creating new designs and components. It is unclear what the appropriate context for each color, text style, etc:</strong> Create structured documentation.</li>
      <li><strong>While files were migrated from Sketch to Figma, we did not take full advantage of Figma’s features, resulting in inefficient use of components:</strong> Use variants and component properties to create an efficient component library.</li>
      <li><strong>Confusing file organization results in additional manual communication:</strong> Reorganize files for intuitive organization</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
	<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1">
    <p>Next, we gathered pain points from the design team. the biggest pain point was that there were multiple versions of the same component that were all slightly different and using different naming conventions, meaning additional work for design and dev, and a more confusing user experience. Other pain points were lack of documentation, not enough use of variants and components properties, and confusing file organization. We proposed high level solutions that also became the scope of the project. </p>
    <p>To solve the multiple components issue, I put together a component directory of all of the components across the different teams. And this was really eye opening seeing all the variants side by side and inconsistencies with text size, spacing, alignment, color, etc. Putting together the component directory also helped with standardized the naming conventions for components.</p>

<h2 id="concept">Creating a Design System</h2>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-5">
    <p>At a high level, we wanted this to be sustainable, recognizable and cohesive. We didn’t want to redesign the brand, we just wanted to create a system that we could continue to build from and strengthen.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-5">
    <p>Then, we created a nested structure so people could easily find what they’re looking for. </p>
  </div>
	<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Atoms:</strong> high-level system patterns, i.e. color, typography, shapes, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Molecules:</strong> parts of the system that cannot be further broken down, i.e. control inputs, labels, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Components:</strong> containers of system patterns, i.e. cards, modules, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Almost half of the accessibility issues that were found in the audit were color related, so we decided that this was the largest impact and lowest effort change that we could make first. So we tweaked the design color system to make sure that we were meeting WCAG AA contrast guidelines.</p>
  </figcaption>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

    <p>Next, we created text styles that would pass text size guidelines for accessibility, which was the second biggest bucket of issues that were found in the audit.</p>

    <p>The last main accessibility issue was making sure we had focus and hover states for all of our components, and making sure these states were consistent. So for hover states, we decided on using the different shades of our primary interaction color, and for focus, using a 2px boundary box.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Documentation</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

    <p>For documentation, we started high level documentation for the components that would be used across teams, as well as color usage. We also developed the structure for a longer term solution that would be a more thorough documentation of each component as collaboration between design and engineering. </p>

<h2 id="brainstorming-co-creation-and-prototyping">Learnings and Impact</h2>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
    <p>These accessibility efforts led to a successful partnership with Veterans Affairs, as well as better communication with developers and within the design team. </p>
    <p>As we continue to expand our offerings, it’s important to realize that the work is never done and there are also new biases to uncover.</p>
