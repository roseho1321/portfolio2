<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Foundation Medicine is a cancer genomics insights company that seeks to provide personalized targeted treatments based off of genomic data. Currently, these genomic reports are only accessible to clinicians. This project seeks to explore a patient facing experience. </p>
    <p>Client Services, FMI’s help center, currently receives 10-20 calls everyday from patients who are inquiring about their test. </p>

    <p>There are many challenges when it comes to patient reporting, from legal issues to clinician hesitancy. Additionally, every patient is different, and one of the main challenges we faced was designing a report that wouldn't overwhelm patients while giving them enough information to feel empowered. </p>

    <p>The design team, consisting of me, Kristyn, and Serena, put together a 2 week design sprint engaging 25 internal FMI members, 10 oncologist and care team members, and 10 patients.</p>

  <div class="col-md-5">

    <p>Once we reduced the scope and focused in on the highest value products, we congregated around one central HWE, framed around the patient experience. From our research, we created personas to represent different types of patients to ensure that we were designing for a variety of users. We also mapped these users onto a journey map to determine where in their treatment process we could create the most impact. </p>

    <p>Our defining design principles that guided our process were accessibility, actionability and ease of understanding.</p>
    <p>The clinician must have some level of transparency and control over sharing results with patients. Patients must always have access to the report and/or additional context. For actionability, a decision insight helps oncologists answer the question “How should I best care for my patient?” Finally, physicians are time-constrained; FMI will do our best to condense insights wherever possible. Patients need to have the right level of information at the right point in time.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
    <p>A physical report is an easier short term solution, easy to refer to in clinic, and fits into the model that many patients use to keep records currently. A digital experience is more comprehensive and offers a greater level of customization, but requires additional layers of effort (security/login).</p>

    <p>While some patients want to know everything about their diagnosis and dive into the full report, a majority of patients only want to know the actionable findings (FDA approved therapies). We decided to offer a customized patient summary in our longer term solution to solve for different user needs.</p>

    <p>The most important concern we had was to make sure we weren’t presenting patients with information that would overwhelm them, or complex medical jargon without a way to decipher what it means. We included a way to chat with FMI representatives so that they could always have their questions answered. We also wanted to connect patients with resources so that they know they are not alone in their treatment journey. </p>

<h2 id="brainstorming-co-creation-and-prototyping">Learnings and Impact</h2>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
    <p>This project taught me a lot about challenging assumptions, and we learned many insights through our research. While we often hear from clinicians to simpify due to time constraints, patients, on the other hand, have the time to learn more about their results, as long as they are given the resources to understand them. We also began with the assumption that older patients would prefer the PDF report, but smartphones are ubiquitous and easily accessible. </p>
    <p>Finally, we found that a customized digital experience still cannot replace human to human interaction. This is ultimately a tool to aid the relationship between a patient and their cancer, as well as the patient and their provider. </p>

    <p>After sharing these findings with FMI, we have begun a piloting program where patient summaries are manually distributed to patients who opt in.</p>
