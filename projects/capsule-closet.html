    <p>
      People often own a lot more clothing than they actually wear. However, it is difficult to anticipate how much a clothing item will be worn prior to purchasing. It can be difficult to find affordable pieces that are sustainable. People don’t necessarily know the “true cost” of their clothing (environmental costs and lifespan).
      </p>

    <p>
      Capsule Closet seeks to address this issue by incorporating elements of sustainable fashion, secondhand shopping, swapping with friends, and capsule closets, while maintaining individuality and the playfulness of exploring fashion options. Capsule Closet celebrates each individual garment and educate users on prolonging the life cycle of their garments. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By creating a 'library' of clothing, users can be inspired by what their friends are wearing while experimenting with their own sense of fashion.

    <p>We surveyed 41 people, with a majority of respondents (85.4%) being between the ages of 18-24, on their behaviour and goals when shopping. Some of the key pain points we found were unintentional overconsumption, an interest an sustainable but lack of means to afford sustainable clothing, and difficulty knowing what to do with old clothes to avoid ending up in the landfill. </p>
    <p>
      We then mapped these pain points to potential solutions and features that would address these pain points. We grouped similar solutions and prioritized higher impact ideas to come up with an MVP design.

      One of the main misconceptions about capsule wardrobes that we discovered during the research process was that people thought this meant they could only own neutrals, they would be wearing the same clothing everyday, and they could only own very few pieces of clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, for the purposes of Capsule Closet, we define creating a capsule wardrobe as loving and wearing all of the pieces in the wardrobe often. This means being intentional about what you own and treasuring each piece in your closet. We wanted to make this process as fun as possible and get rid of the stigma and intimidation factor when it comes to capsule closets. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the app, users can swap pieces with their community, quickly and easily see which outfits they own, see their favorite outfits, and purchase sustainable and secondhand clothing options.
