    <p>With over 50% of patients with chronic conditions failing to adhere to their treatment plan, the effects of medication non adherence range from patients being readmitted to the hospital and facing complications to pharmaceutical companies losing billions of dollars each year. With the growth of wearable technologies, we were tasked by our partners at ExpressScripts and Capacity to help bridge the gap of adherence. </p>

    <p>For this project, I worked with Victoria Xu (illustration) and Brandon Wilburn (ring design). My role was interaction design and UX design. We all conducted UX research for this project.</p>

    <p>For our first round of research, we interviewed 15 people, ranging from ages 19-70, from students taking medication regularly for the first time to healthcare professionals interacting with a diverse range of patients.  These were friends and families in our lives and also health professionals at the Barnes Jewish Hospital. </p>

    <p>We then created user flow mapping (below) using insights from the interviews and noted pain points throughout the process. </p>

<h2 id="brainstorming-co-creation-and-prototyping">Ideation</h2>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-5">
    <p>We then interviewed 2 nurses to begin our ideation process. Early ideas that we had included:  </p>
  </div>
	<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1">
    <ul>
      <li>A scale that tracks the weight of remaining pills, orders refills when low</li>
      <li>Apple watch to remind you to take your medications</li>
      <li>A band for younger audiences, as to not break</li>
      <li>A ring that resembles a string tied around your finger</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-5">
    <p>We decided to implement a wearable ring after feedback. Patients are given a reminder ring that also connects to a backend system which Users and Caregivers can access. This system employs AI to determine the best time to remind you over time and RFID to register your completed doses.</p>
    <p>Pain points we specifically wanted to address were:</p>
  </div>
	<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Forgetting the medication at home:</strong> Ring will buzz if you leave your house without your medication </li>
      <li><strong>Forgetting to take medication:</strong> Ring is something you can always wear and provides discrete reminders </li>
      <li><strong>Keeping track of how regularly you take your medication:</strong> Calendar view of daily adherence </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">

    <p>We wanted to narrow down the initial scope of Pill Pal to one disorder. We knew the disorder needed to have serious consequences for medication non-adherence, and required a range of pills that could fit on the visible part of the ring. After making a paper model, we determined the number of medications should be 9 or less, in order to have the colors on the ring be spaced out far enough to be distinctive.</p>

    <p>From there, we did further research into disorders would fit into our criteria and interviewed 2 doctors (a cardiologist and a general practitioner) and we narrowed it down to: Alzheimer’s/Dementia, heart disease, and diabetes. We initially thought Alzheimer’s would be an interesting venue to pursue, but decided it was difficult to gauge the amount of caretaker involvement that would be required. </p>

    <p>We chose to focus on creating a device for heart disease patients. From coronary artery disease to hypertension, there is a variety of heart diseases that are often comorbid, leading to patients having to take many medications regularly. Medical adherence is also a prominent issue in heart disease treatment, making it an ideal target for our solution. Heart disease is also the leading cause of death in the US: 1 in 4 American deaths/year, with erratic compliance specifically being a cause of significant complications (ie. rebound hypertension, heart failure). Heart failure patients take an average of 6.8 medications regularly, which is within the range for our proposed device. </p>
    <p>After a meeting with our partners at ExpressScripts, we realized a few problems with our early designs. We originally had a band of lights going all the way around the ring but realized that was not feasible because patients would not be able to see the light. We also decided to scrap the band idea in order to hone in on the ring design. We did this because it would be more of a challenge to design on a smaller device, and the design could always be scaled up (See Next Steps).</p>
    <p>Initially, the app for Pill Pal was much more comprehensive, including features such as a help call . After reviewing with ExpressScripts, we decided that it was more important to integrate the app and the ring. We also spoke to patients, and considering the oversaturated market for health adherence apps, we decided to make the ring a standalone device, with the app being a secondary feature. This would simplify the onboarding process and make it as accessible as possible.</p>

<h2 id="concept-video">Storyboarding</h2>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">

    <p>Based off our interviews, we developed persona as an example of a potential early user of Pill Pal: </p>

    <p>Walter is a 61-year-old fire inspector from Virginia. About seven months ago, he experienced a heart attack. His doctor diagnosed him with coronary heart disease and hypertension and prescribed him a number of medications. Even though he experienced such a dangerous cardiac episode, however, Walter still has trouble adhering to the regimen. His wife often has to remind him to take his medications throughout the day, and he simply does not register the gravity of missing doses. From here, we created our storyboard.

<div class="row">

    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Color coded lights:</strong> The ring lights up with multiple colors to match color coded pill bottles or routine events, making health adherence simple for patients. </li>
      <li><strong>Vibration:</strong> For a more discrete setting, the ring can also vibrate to alert patients of an event or medication.  </li>
      <li><strong>RFID sticker:</strong> Color-coded to match its LED reminder light on the ring, will be on the bottle cap, which the ring can sense upon contact to register that the patient has taken their medication.</li>
      <li><strong>Location tracking:</strong> Through the RFID, the ring will vibrate when patients leave the house without their medication.   </li>
      <li><strong>Snooze:</strong> If patients are unable to do a task when it is scheduled, it is possible to snooze the alert for 15 minutes by tapping twice on the ring.   </li>
      <li><strong>Multiple finishes:</strong> In order for the ring to feel more like an accessory and less like a health adherence device, we have created 3 different versions (wood, steel and silicon) in order for patients to have more choices.   </li>

<h2 id="overall-feedback-and-next-steps">Next Steps and Learnings</h2>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
    <p>We are looking to build/3D print a physical model to get feedback from potential users  By doing this, we hope to gain insight on the unseen interactions that would come naturally to the user. We are also hoping to expand the design to different accessories. Since we want the ring to function as an accessory as well as a health device, the ring could potentially be expanded into a line of many different forms of jewelry. Possible future directions include wristbands, necklace, and earrings. Additionally, while Pill Pal is currently focused on heart disease patients, we hope to do more research into expanding the system for patients with diabetes. </p>
    <p>During this project, I learned to design with accessibility in mind. By designing for an older population, there were additional accessibility factors that were crucial to take into account, and user interviews helped me uncover these. I also learned the importance of considering edge cases. A big challenge we faced was thinking about how to design for patients taking 20+ medications. It was necessary to narrow the scope of our project to ensure that patients have the optimal experience. </p>
